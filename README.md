  • My name is Michael Adebambo, I'm 17 years old.

      I started my journey into tech during the pandemic in 2020, around July if could remember..

       I dabbled around different technologies from JavaScript to PHP, react and python cos I had no one to guide me.. it was 😣 but one thing I had was inquisitiveness and readiness to learn so I read a lot of blogs and articles about " how to be a developer" and different tech stack and requirements

          I stopped learning cos I had to go school for me final exams (WAEC) so I blah blah blah untill early( January ) this year.

   • A new journey began. I think I got direction of what I wanted to learn and what I wanted.

  -  I choose to be a front-end developer cos of the versatility and precisely the power of Javascript

  -    So I started with some [freecodecamp](www.freecodecamp.com) courses and random videos online but I had some drawbacks like;
#### Roadmap

#### Discipline

#### Consistency

      •  I got some help and I'm doing quite fine if not for lack of motivation and support from my family but I'm trying my best.
